<h1>The Capizzi Story </h1>

<p>
Everything we serve here at Capizzi is made as if you are going back to my Grandmother's house for a holiday.
 Back then everything had to be the best and I mean everything! One bakery had the best bread but not the best cake. 
 One pork store might have the best sausage but the chicken market had the best chicken and so on. My parents and grandparents 
 shopped for days all over Brooklyn. As a child I didn't understand it. Who cares who has the best? Why not just go to the supermarket
  and get everything? ("God forbid" Nonna would say) But as I got older, I realized it's not just about good food. It was like a sport, 
  a passion of nature and a love affair with food all rolled up into one. When I was a kid, I worked by my father & grandfathers' side in their 
  pizza shops and I too developed the passion and love for the art of food. There is a great deal of pleasure that comes with serving something really special. 
  At Capizzi, we shop the world to bring you the best regardless of price. I invite you to step out of Hell's Kitchen and go back in time to Nonna's kitchen, where things are made with a sense of love and pride.
